// Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array.
// Situation of hash collision: When two keys have the same hash value.
// Open Addressing: When a collision occurs, we find the next empty slot in the array.
// Chaining: When a collision occurs, we store the keys in the same index of the array in the form of a linked list.
// Load Factor: The ratio of the number of keys to the number of slots in the array.
// Rehashing: When the load factor exceeds a certain threshold, we increase the size of the array and rehash all the keys.
// Java provides a HashTable class that implements the Map interface.
// Classes that implement the Map interface: HashSet, HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, HashTable. These are all part of Collections Framework.
