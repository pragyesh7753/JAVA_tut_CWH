        There are 3 types of error:-
        1. Syntax Error -
                When compiler finds something wrong with our program, it throws an error called Syntax Error.
        2. Logical Error/Semantic Error -
                A logical error/semantic error or a bug occurs when a program compiles and runs but does the wrong thing.
                ex- message delivered wrongly.
                    wrong time of chats being displayed.
                    incorrect redirects.
        3. Runtime Error -
                Java may sometimes encounter an error while the program is running. These are also called exceptions. 
                These are encountered due to circumstances like bad input and or resource constraints.
                ex- user supplies '5'+ 8 to a program which adds 2 numbers. This will throw an exception.
        
        -> Syntax errors and logical errors are encountered by the programmer where as runtime errors are encountered by the user.
